<p>An Architecture for A Scalable Wide Area Distributed Systems</a> </p>

<h5>abstract</h5>

<p>Current wide area distributed systems fail to hide implementation aspects related to
the distribution of information. Unfortunately, the solutions developed for local systems
do not scale, so a different approach is needed. In this paper we present an architecture
for distributed systems that scales to support a large number of users and objects. The
architecture is based on the concept of distributed shared objects, which are used for
sharing and exchanging information over wide area networks. Our architecture provides
location and replication transparency, and offers the flexibility needed to cope with the
heterogeneity inherent in wide area systems. </p>

Area Distributed Systems</a> </p>

<h5>abstract</h5>

<p>In order to facilitate the construction of wide area distributed systems, it is
necessary that we adopt a model that simplifies application development. In this position
paper we advocate an object-based approach. Our approach allows for flexibility because
many of the technical details of distribution, such as communication protocols,
consistency rules, etc. can be hidden behind the objects' interfaces. In addition, we
allow distributed objects to offer alternative implementations for an interface. A client
may choose the most suitable implementation. We discuss the use of distributed objects as
the means to this end, and compare our approach to existing ones. </p>

Distributed Systems</a> </p>

<h5>abstract</h5>

<p>Current distributed applications like E-mail, electronic news, distributed calendars,
and network information browsers often have a complex structure. This is partly due to
lack of suitable support from the underlying operating system, which is often too low
level. At the same time, multi media applications, parallel programs, wide-area
applications, and database systems have very different operating system demands. Although
it is possible to put support for the above-mentioned systems in a single operating system
kernel, this is generally undesirable from a software engineering point of view, as the
resulting software may become unmanageable. </p>

<p>In this paper we describe a new model for constructing operating systems and
applications in an integrated fashion. Compared to current approaches we provide
high-level primitives for supporting distributed and parallel applications. We also
provide the flexibility to configure both applications and kernels to only include the
functionality that is actually used. </p>

<!-- Initial strong statement to get them interested -->

<p>The <strong>Caltech Infospheres Project</strong> researches <strong>compositional
systems</strong>, which are systems built from interacting components. We are concerned
with the theory and implementation of compositional systems that support peer-to-peer
communication among persistent multithreaded distributed objects. Though we implement
example systems and services in Java and Web technologies, our theories, models, and ideas
are directly applicable to any distributed component-based system. Our group is primarily
concerned with developing reliable distributed applications by composing existing and
newly created software components in structured ways. <strong>

<p>The Ninja project aims to develop a software infrastructure to support the next
generation of Internet-based applications. Central to the Ninja approach is the concept of
a <b>service</b>, an Internet-accessible application (or set of applications) which is <em>scalable</em>
(able to support many thousands of concurrent users), <em>fault-tolerant</em> (able to
mask faults in the underlying server hardware), and <em>highly-available</em> (resilient
to network and hardware outages). Examples of current and future Ninja services include an
Internet stock-trading system; a ``universal inbox'' used to access e-mail, voice mail,
pages, and other personal correspondence; and the <a href="http://ninja.cs.berkeley.edu/demos/demos.html">Ninja Jukebox</a>, which provides
real-time streaming audio data served from a collection of music CDs scattered about the
network. </p>

<p>In some sense, the current World Wide Web is a service itself; Ninja intends to build
upon and expand the notion of Web-based services by providing <em>composability</em> (the
ability to automatically aggregate multiple services together into a single entity), <em>customizability</em>
(the ability for users to inject code into the system to customize a service's behavior),
and <em>accessibility</em> (the ability to access the service from a wide range of
devices, including PCs, workstations, cellphones, and Personal Digital Assistants). The
end goal of the Ninja project is to enable the development of a menagerie of
Internet-based services which are interoperable and immediately accessible across the
spectrum of user devices ranging from PCs and workstations to cellphones and Personal
Digital Assistants. For example, one should be able to check one's e-mail simply by
calling a special number from a cellphone, or equivalently by sitting down at any
Internet-connected PC in the world.

<h2><a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/spl/groups/eca/pubs/papers/PARC-AOP-D97/">D: A
Language Framework for Distributed Programming </a></h2>

<p>Cristina Videira Lopes, <a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/spl/members/gregor/">Gregor
Kiczales</a></p>

<p>We present an object-oriented language framework for distributed programming called D.
D uses the aspect ori-ented programming approach to allow the code for the basic
functionality of a distributed application to be writ-ten without having to explicitly
deal with distribution and synchronization. Separate code deals with those issues. </p>

<p>The D language framework consists of: (i) Jcore, an object-oriented language used to
express the basic function-ality and the activity of the system; (ii) Cool, a language
used to express coordination of threads; and (iii) Ridl, a language used to express remote
access strategies. A special tool called an Aspect Weaver&#153; takes the programs written
in the different languages and combines them together to produce an executable program
with the speci-fied distributed behavior. D builds on existing object-oriented languages,
and aggressively adheres to syntactic separation of distribution concerns. D program texts
are less tangled and therefore simpler and more reusable than their equivalents written in
Java. </p>

<p>During this year at LBNL, I worked on a number of projects, some more research-oriented
than others, including the <a href="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/bpf.tar.Z">BSD Packet Filter
(BPF)</a>, <a href="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump.tar.Z">tcpdump</a>, the BSD kernel
debugger, the BSD <i>kvm</i> library, and the Network Animator <i>nam</i>. BPF improves
upon earlier packet capture designs and has been integrated into a number of commercial
Unix implementations including Digital Unix and HP-UX. I refined the <i>tcpdump</i> filter
specfication language and developed a compiler and optimizer to translate high-level
filter specifications into virtual machine code for the BPF filtering engine. For this
system, I developed a number of novel optimization techniques tailored specifically to
packet filters. Eventually, I factored out the compiler and optimizer into a re-usuable
library called <a href="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z">libpcap</a>. (The initial
version of <i>libpcap</i> was intended as a rough prototype, but I never found the time to
finish and refine it, and unfortunately, doing this now is confounded by the large number
of applications that assume its current form.) <i>Tcpdump</i> has become a widely used
network monitoring, debugging, and data acquistion tool. </p>

<p>Esterel is both a language, dedicated to programming reactive systems, and a compiler
which translates Esterel programs into finite-state automata. It is one of a family of
synchronous languages which are particularly well-suited to programming reactive systems,
including real-time systems and control automata. </p>

<p>The compiler can be used to generate a hardware or software implementation of the
reactive kernel: either C-code is generated which can then be embedded in a larger program
that handles the interface and data manipulations, or hardware is generated in the form of
netlists of gates, which can then be embedded in a larger system. There is a symbolic,
graphical debugger, and support for verification in the form of bisimulation or BDD-based
safety property checking. In addition, extensive optimization is available. </p>

Specification Using the Silage Language</a></p>
<i>

<p align="center">Paul Hilfinger and Jan Rabaey</i> </p>

<p><a name="756799"></a>Digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms are most easily
described using a block diagram or schematic representation of the data flow in the
algorithm. This can be captured in a graphical format[Lee89, Goering90], which is
convenient if the number of blocks is relatively small and the interconnection is not
complex. For more complex systems it is often more convenient to use a text
representation. However, the commonly used procedural languages such as C, impose an
ordering on the operations, and the variables actually represent memory locations, rather
than true arithmetic values from which meaningful arithmetic equations can be written. An
applicative (functional or single assignment) language accurately represents the
computation which is to be performed, rather than how it is to be calculated. Silage is
such a language with the addition of constructs (e.g. delay) that are commonly found in
DSP applications.</p>
